```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
Create directory for dataset, load and unzip file, install packages. 

```{r load_data}

Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "en")
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME","C")

if( !file.exists("./data")) {  
        dir.create("./data")  
        fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"  
        dstf <- "./data/activity.zip"  
        download.file(fileUrl, destfile = dstf, method = "curl")  
        unzip(zipfile = dstf,exdir= "./data")  
} 

if(!is.element("lattice", installed.packages()[,1])) {
  install.packages("lattice")
}
```

Read file and create dataset.
```{r read_data}
dataset <- read.table("./data/activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", na.strings = "NA")
dataset$date <- as.Date(dataset$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day.
```{r calculate_steps}
DaySteps <- tapply(dataset$steps,dataset$date,function(x) sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)) 
DaySteps
```

Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.
```{r histogram_ds}
hist(DaySteps,col="lightblue",xlab="Number of steps", main="Total number of steps taken each day")
```

Calculate the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.
```{r calculate_mean_median}
Stmean <- mean(DaySteps, na.rm=TRUE)
Stmedian <- median(DaySteps,na.rm=TRUE)

```
The mean is : **`r sprintf("%.2f",Stmean)`** and the median is : **`r sprintf("%.0f",Stmedian)`**.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

A time series of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r line_plot, fig.height=6}
steps_per_intv <- with(dataset, tapply(steps, interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
plot(unique(dataset$interval), steps_per_intv, type = "l", 
     main = "Daily activity time series", pch = 2, col = "darkblue",
     ylab = "Averaged across all days, steps", xlab = "Time interval, 5-minute")
```

5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, that contains the maximum number of steps.
```{r calculate_max_interval}
maxvalue <- max( steps_per_intv )
maxnames <- names( which( steps_per_intv == max( steps_per_intv )))

```

The 5-minute interval, that contains the maximum number of steps is `r maxnames` with average number of `r round(maxvalue,1)` steps.    


## Imputing missing values

Calculate the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
```{r calculate_miss_val}
sum(is.na(dataset))
```

Create new dataset for filling the all missing values. Next, create a new column in which fill in all values as mean of 5-minute interval. After that fill all the missing values with values from the new column.
```{r new_dataset_str}
newdataset <- dataset
newdataset$msteps <- tapply(dataset$steps,dataset$interval,function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) 
newdataset[is.na(newdataset$steps),]$steps <- newdataset[is.na(newdataset$steps),]$msteps
```

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in. Delete the new column and create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r new_dataset}
newdataset <- newdataset[-c(4)]
```
Check: number of the missing values in the new dataset
```{r num_miss_val}
sum(is.na(newdataset))
```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
```{r histogram_newds }
NewDS <- tapply(newdataset$steps,newdataset$date,function(x) sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)) 
hist(NewDS,col="pink",xlab="Number of steps", main="Total number of steps taken each day (w/o missing values")
```

Calculate the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day for the new dataset.
```{r calculate_new_mm}
NewStmean <- mean(NewDS, na.rm=TRUE)
NewStmedian <- median(NewDS,na.rm=TRUE)

```

The mean is **`r sprintf("%.2f", NewStmean)`** and the median is **`r sprintf("%.0f", NewStmedian)`** for the new dataset.

```{r calculate_diff}
diffmean <-  NewStmean - Stmean
diffmedian <- NewStmedian - Stmedian
```

The difference of mean values for the newdataset and dataset is : **`r sprintf("%.2f",diffmean)`**.  
The difference of median values for the newdataset and dataset is : **`r sprintf("%.0f",diffmedian)`**.  

The impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps is:    
 - we have received higher mean and median values for the total daily number of steps;  
 - w/o the missing values, the Histogram is closer to a normal distribution, so the values of the mean and median are closer to each other.  
  
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Use the newdataset with the filled-in missing values. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day
```{r create_week}
dayweek <- data.frame(
  cbind(
    name = c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday",
             "Saturday","Sunday"),
      daytype = c(rep("weekday",5),rep("weekend",2))))
str(dayweek)
```

Add a new column for the new dataset with "weekends" and "weekdays" values.
```{r modify_newds}
daytype <- merge(dayweek,data.frame(
    name=weekdays(as.Date(newdataset$date))))$daytype
WeekDS <- cbind(newdataset,daytype)
```

Calculate the average number of steps taken for each interval, separately for weekdays and weekends and create dataset for plot
```{r calculate_average}
WeekDS$msteps <- tapply(WeekDS$steps,WeekDS$interval,function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) 
WeekDS <- WeekDS[-c(1,2)]
```

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken. 
```{r panel_plot}
library(lattice)
xyplot(WeekDS$msteps ~ WeekDS$interval |
         WeekDS$daytype , type = "l",
       ylab = "Averaged across all days, steps", xlab = "Time interval, 5-minute",
       main = "Daily activity time series", layout = c(1,2))
```
